Epic Edit is a track editor for Super Mario Kart (SNES). It lets you edit the track tiles, objects, and the driver AI, among other things. It requires a Super Mario Kart ROM, which is not included.

This application is written in C# and uses Windows.Forms. It is distributed under the GPL. It requires the .NET Framework 2.0 or above on Windows, and also works with Mono on Linux. It works on Mac too, using Mono with an X11 server installed, by passing a command line argument, this way: MONO_MWF_MAC_FORCE_X11=1 mono EpicEdit.exe
